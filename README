        Program is working correctly. I have not found any segfaults 
    or resources that do not get closed.

    Options:
        -h: Help
        -s: Limits the number of concurrent user proceesses to the given number(int).
        -l: The given argument(string) specifies the neame of the logfile.
        -t: The given number(int) specifies the max amount of time the program will run for.
               
    Difficulties:
        I had a bit of trouble geting the structure of the main loops correct. I ended up 
        re-writing these sections several times. I did not have too much trouble getting the
        semephores to work, other than a bit of trouble figuring out the arguments of the
        command.
